# Things React Clone
I'm currently learning React and as a way of practice I'm trying to build the closest thing I can to
the [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) macOS app. I'm focusing first on functionality and then on the styling (I'm leaving the Todo Card to the end).

This is how it currently looks.
